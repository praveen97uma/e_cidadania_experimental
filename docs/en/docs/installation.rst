Installing with nginx + FastCGI
-------------------------------

.. note:: The installtion through FastCGI should work for other web servers since
          FastCGI is the one who handles e-cidadania, and the server only serves
          the static content.

The installation with nginx and FastCGI...

This section is in development.

Now you can continue to "Configuration".
